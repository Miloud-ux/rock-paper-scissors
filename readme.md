# Rock paper sissors game made in python
This is a simple rock, paper , sissors game made in python that has a simple Menu
# Structure : 
- Game runs in the main while true loop that clears the screen and displays the menu
- Uses match-case statement to hove throgh the menu.
- Can add other entities into the game (water , fire...etc) and set rules for them
- Uses two functions :
1. add_entity() : Adds a new "move" to the game example : water, fire...etc
2. exit_game() : Prints an exiting message with simple dots ellipsis animation
# Improvements 
- Add some additional error checking when the user presses other letters than the (y/n) confirmation

Thank you :)
