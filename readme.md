# Rock paper sissors game made in python
This is a simple rock, paper , sissors game made in python that has a simple Menu
# Structure : 
- Game runs in the main while true loop that clears the screen and displays the menu
- Uses match-case statement to hove throgh the menu.
- Uses two functions :
1. valid_player_choice() : to check whether the player chose a valid option (rock, paper, sissors)
2. exit_game() : Prints an exiting message with simple dots ellipsis animation
# Improvements 
- Add a dictionarry to handle the game's logic instead of the if  statements (wanted to keep my original implementation)
- Add a single player mode (random choice by the computer)
- Optional : print ASCII hands instead when player makes a choice.

Thank you :)
